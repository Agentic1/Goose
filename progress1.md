Got it—we’re aligned.

You want your own AG web/Telegram/etc. frontends to talk to AG1Goose (the brain) through a bus‑native relay, not to reuse Goose’s UI. Goose sits behind the relay, runs sessions, tools, and orchestration. Frontends publish user input on the bus; the relay feeds it into Goose; Goose replies; the relay returns the response to the frontend via the bus.

     Goose engine / CLI server
     - sessions, recipes, subagents, MCP
Why this design
Your frontends remain yours. No need to mimic Goose’s WS protocol or UI.

Goose stays the brain. It runs sessions, subagents, recipes, and MCP tools (including your ag1_mcp_server you already built). 
Block
Block
Block

Bus semantics everywhere. Correlation IDs, durable XADD/XREAD, backpressure, observability—same pattern you’ve standardized.

Security boundary. Goose can remain on a private node; only the bridge talks to it.

What we build next
1) ag1goose-bridge crate (Rust)
Responsibilities:

Subscribe to AG1:agent:GooseAgent:inbox (and optionally per-session streams like AG1:agent:GooseAgent:<sid>:inbox).

Map envelope → Goose session input.

session_code (if present) resumes the same Goose session; else create one and store mapping {session_code ↔ goose_session_id} in Redis.

content.text becomes the user message.

Always include meta as an object; forward useful bits into Goose notes/headers.

Invoke Goose:

Preferred: call Goose in‑process via the goose crate APIs (start an engine, send user turn, await response).
If the public API is insufficient, start with the CLI path below while we spike a minimal in‑proc wrapper.

Pragmatic now: spawn goose session --name <sid> --with-builtin developer and stream stdin/stdout, or use goose web’s local HTTP endpoints if available. The docs expose goose web and goose session flows we can lean on today. 
Block

Reply: write the answer to reply_to with same correlation_id, set envelope_type: "message_reply", populate meta.x_stream_key, timestamp, and set envelope_id to the XADD id you receive.

Note: Goose’s interfaces are primarily CLI/Web/MCP. There isn’t a documented stable Rust SDK for embedding the “engine” directly; we may need to read the crates/goose internals and create a thin adapter. Until then, the CLI/session route is supported and documented. 
Block
GitHub

2) Keep ag1_mcp_server enabled inside Goose
You already proved:

ag1_list, ag1_describe, ag1_delegate work.

That lets Goose delegate to any AG1 agent through the bus.
This stays as Goose’s tool surface. 
Block

3) Frontend handlers (existing)
Your web/Telegram handlers already publish envelopes. Nothing changes—just target reply_to = AG1:agent:GooseAgent:inbox (or a per‑session stream the bridge advertises in first reply).

Concrete stream naming
Inbound to Goose bridge (from frontends):

AG1:agent:GooseAgent:inbox (default shared)

Optional per session: AG1:agent:GooseAgent:<session_code>:inbox

Outbound replies (from bridge back to frontend):

Use the reply_to provided in each envelope.

Correlation: the bridge should accept either:

correlation_id set by the frontend; or

if absent, generate one and include it in reply.

Minimal bridge loop (pseudo)
rust
Copy
Edit
loop {
  if let Some(env) = bus.recv_block(inbox, &last_id, 500).await? {
    last_id = env.envelope_id.clone().unwrap_or(last_id);
    let sid = env.session_code.clone().unwrap_or_else(|| new_sid());
    let reply_to = env.reply_to.clone().unwrap_or(default_frontend_stream());

    // 1) Ensure Goose session
    let sref = ensure_goose_session(&sid).await?;

    // 2) Send user turn -> await model reply
    let answer = goose_send_and_wait(&sref, env.content).await?;

    // 3) Reply
    let reply_env = Envelope {
      role: "agent".into(),
      content: answer, // {"text": "...", optional rich structure}
      agent_name: Some("GooseAgent".into()),
      envelope_type: Some("message_reply".into()),
      correlation_id: env.correlation_id.clone(),
      meta: json!({ "x_stream_key": inbox }),
      reply_to: Some(reply_to.clone()),
      timestamp: Some(Utc::now().to_rfc3339()),
      ..Default::default() // ensuring all required string fields are present
    };
    bus.send(&reply_to, &reply_env).await?;
  }
}
(You already implemented most of this behavior in ag1_meta + bus—we’ll reuse those crates.)

How to talk to Goose from the bridge
Phase 1 (quickest, proven path): spawn CLI sessions

Start once per session:

goose session --name <sid> --with-builtin developer --with-extension "<cmd to ag1_mcp_server>"

Write user input lines to the session stdin (or use goose run --interactive as a controller process).

Capture output; extract final assistant message for reply.

Docs confirming CLI and Web entry points: 
Block

Repo shows crates/ with CLI/server/desktop (so you know where to look if you later embed): 
GitHub

Phase 2 (better): embed Goose engine

Investigate crates/goose to create an engine, configure providers, enable extensions, and send turns directly.

There isn’t a formal embeddable API documented; we’ll read crates/goose-cli/src/session and related goose modules to extract a minimal surface. If we can’t get a stable API, we keep Phase 1 and upstream a small “engine-sdk” PR later. This approach aligns with Goose’s MCP + subagent model. 
Block
Block

Security & ops checklist
Auth: Require a bearer/API key on edge frontends; validate in the handler before publishing to GooseAgent inbox.

Isolation: One Goose process per tenant or shared with internal session limits.

Backpressure: Use consumer groups for high‑throughput, one group per bridge instance:

XGROUP CREATE AG1:agent:GooseAgent:inbox goose-bridge $ MKSTREAM

Use XREADGROUP GROUP goose-bridge <instance> BLOCK 500 COUNT 10 STREAMS ... >

Timeouts & retries:

CLI/embed timeout per turn (e.g., 120s).

If Goose crashes, bridge can restart session and send a diagnostic reply.

Logging: Log to stderr; never mix with bus payloads.

Observability: write a small status heartbeat to AG1:service:goose_bridge:status with load metrics.

What you can do right now
Create crates/ag1goose-bridge using your existing bus and ag1_meta helpers.

Start with Phase 1: spawn goose session --name <sid> and pipe stdin/stdout.

Enable ag1_mcp_server in the session so Goose can delegate over the bus.

Test end‑to‑end:

Web handler → AG1:agent:GooseAgent:inbox

Bridge → Goose → ag1_mcp_server → HeartBeatService → reply_to.

If you’d like, I can draft the initial Rust skeleton for ag1goose-bridge (binary crate) that:

uses XREADGROUP,

manages sessions in a small Redis hash,

spawns goose session processes,

and returns replies with matching correlation_id.

Shall I generate that scaffold next?

# Progress Report for AetherBus Integration into Goose

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to implement AetherBus integration into the Goose codebase, focusing on using the `envelope` structure for communication.

## Objectives
1. Ensure all messages sent to AetherBus use the `Envelope` structure.
2. Implement asynchronous communication through the `bus` crate.
3. Use `serde` for JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Progress Summary
- **Envelope Structure Implemented**: Integrated the `create_envelope` function to wrap messages appropriately.
- **Key Files Updated**:
  - **`agent.rs`**: Enhanced message handling and dispatching with envelopes.
  - **`sub_recipe_tools.rs`**: Wrapped task creation and completion notifications in envelopes.
  - **`sub_recipe_manager.rs`**: Implemented notifications for dispatch and completion of tasks.
  - **`lib/mod.rs`**: Added envelopes for notification and success results during task execution.

## Proposed Next Steps
1. **Conduct Comprehensive Testing**: Verify that all modified functionalities operate as intended.
2. **Documentation Updates**: Ensure relevant documentation reflects the updated messaging standards and structure.
3. **Deployment Preparation**: Prepare for deployment alongside updates to the AetherBus messaging protocol.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Completed implementation of envelope messaging across core components.
- **Week 2**: Conducting tests and preparing documentation.
